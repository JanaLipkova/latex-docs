\section*{July 03}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plan for walking:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Try quasistatic walking with 0 step height, with the battery in.
\item Try quasistatic walking with flattening of the feet.
\item Try dynamic walking with flattening of the feet.
\item Try running the zmp-daemon realtime using the force/torque sensor and maybe the accelerometer in the pelvis to determine the real ZMP and use that in the Preview Controller every timestep.
\end{enumerate}
\item 1. Worked very well without the battery.
\item 2. Quasistatic walking in place worked well, except that the miscalibration in the left ankle roll caused the robot to fall to the right during single-support, which then caused the dropping leg to hit the ground and push the robot over. But the right side was perfect.
\begin{itemize}
\item x-offset = 0.4m
\item y-offset = 0.0m
\item zmp-R = 1.00 x 10\^-8
\item lookahead time = 2.5s
\item startup = 1.0s
\item shutdown = 1.8s
\item double-support = 2.5s
\item single-support = 1.0s
\item pause time = 0.3s
\item step height = 0.06m
\item step distance = 0.0m
\item half stance width = 0.0885m
\item COM height = 0.45m
\item flattening gains = 0.001
\item decay gain = 0.5
\item min force threshold = 12.0N
\item max force threshold = 55.0N
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item The left PC has login issues. To solve it, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to go to the Terminal. Then type sudo chown groupname:username .Xauthority. Then press Ctl-Alt-F7 to go back to the login and try logging in.
\end{itemize}

\section*{July 02}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Found a weird bug in zmpwalkgenerator.cpp, line 416 in github.com/swatbotics/hubomz/zmp/. If the center of mass IK fails then it gets the body transforms using the walker's local initContext, but it has not been set yet, so jvalues.size() = 0 and therefore the assert in KinBody::transforms() fails.
\item Tested quasistatic walking with 1.5 double-support time. When it first moved to the left foot it did well, but when it shifted to the right, it went way too fast and overshot and fell over. We presume this may be because the double-support time is too short, but just increasing this doesn't seem like a good idea.
\item Figured out that the footstep generation functions don't know anything about the zmp position so the final step ends with the body shifted to the side with the zmp\_y at it's max. So stayDogStay() using the shutdown\_ticks is necessary to bring the zmp\_y back to zero.
\item Tried much longer double-support time with quasistatic walking in place. The first shift to the left foot was perfect, but when Hubo put his right foot back down he fell off balance and then fell to the right as he shifted right. Will implement a feedback controller tomorrow.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item In quasistatic mode the single and double support times need to be very long, which creates a very large trajectory, which currently overflows the ach channel. So we can either increase the ach channel size (temporary plan), or move onto atomic trajectories.
\end{itemize}

\section*{July 01}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with Matt and found bug in hubomz code in zmpwalkgenerator.cpp where the if else statements for pause\_time were switch, so it was interpolating the body rotation over the wrong number of iterations.
\item Tested quasistatic walking on DRC Hubo 1, but when he leaned over the left foot, he ended up falling to the left side. My deduction is that the model is not correct (ie. the center of mass is too low) which caused Hubo to lean to far and thus put his ACTUAL center of mass outside his support foot.
\item Parameters were: X-offset: 0.04, Startup time: 1.0, Shutdown time: 1.0, Double-support time: 0.9, Single-support time: 1.0, Pause time: 0.3, Step height: 0.1, Step distance: 0.22, Lateral distance: 0.0885, Center of mass height: 0.45.
\item I added a function to the Walker class in hubo-motion-rt called balanceAboveFoot that will hopefully help account for the inaccuracies in the model and allow for quasistatic working to work.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item We discovered that the Force/Torque sensors in the ankles were reversed on all the signs when using Hubo-i, but when using hubo\_init, just the right ankle was incorrect.
\item Kiwon Sohn contacted KAIST and they said they purposely set the F/T sensors backwards and since defaulting to the stock firmware will revert them to being backwards, we should just change it in our code. This is not logical at all, but not much we can do about it now.
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 25}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ported our zmp-daemon code over to Matt's new hubomz repo which now works with the new DRC Hubo. Got everything working (ie. forward/backward, sidestepping and turning in place) except that there is something weird going on in the first step of the turn in place.
\item Currently the repo is forked to my user account "pvieira3".
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need to think about best and most logical way to use ZMPParams and where to put them. Currently I have put the ik\_sense and the walktype in zmp-daemon and zmpwalkgenerator includes zmp-daemon. This led to changing some lines in zmpdemo as well.
\item Need to fix turning in place.
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 22}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated hubomz: merged grey/daemonize into master and cleaned up the code some.
\item Now using master for hubomz and hubo\_walk, manipulation for hubo-motion-rt and
develop for hubo-ach.
\item Push Hubo's plastic pieces back on and packed everything for Drexel.
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 21}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item On local PC start 'roscore' and 'rosrun rviz rviz'
\item On hubo-vision start 'roslaunch openni\_launch openni.launch'
\item 'export ROS\_MASTER\_URI=http://COMPUTER\_NAME:11311/'
\item On local PC run 'rosrun rqt\_reconfigure rqt\_reconfigure' and check the camera/driver depth\_registered box
\item On local PC run 'roslaunch hubo\_motion\_ros hubo\_manipulation.launch' (to see camera and hubo)
\item On local PC run 'rosrun hubo\_drc\_vision segment\_image'
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 20}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote a function to test the handle\_angles function in the manipulation-daemon and tested it. It worked fine.
\item Read through basic understanding of Point Cloud Library.
\item Wrote function to convert pcl PointCloud2 from camera to a PointXYZRGB and then compute the point cloud normals and store the two together as a PointXYZRGBNormal to be used for segmentation of planes
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 19}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added function in manipulation daemon to handle raw joint angles for the arms instead of poses, because the IK was coming up with different angles than what was put into the FK on the ROS side.
\item Change board limits for RSR and LSR so that going in toward Hubo's center the limit is 0.36 radians. Somehow they got messed up and were at 0.157 radians. Changed control.table to reflect this.
\item Went through ROS tutorials: "Services \& Parameters", "Using rqt\_console and roslaunch", "Using rosed to edit files in ROS", "Creating a ROS msg and srv", "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber", "Examining the Simple Publisher and Subscriber", "Writing a Simple Service and Client", "Examining the Simple Service and Client".
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 18}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Discovered control table has conservative limits on shoulder roll joints. Currently +/- 0.3, but really should be +/-0.4. Discuss reasons with Grey.
roslaunch hubo\_motion\_ros hubo\_state.launch.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Todo}
\begin{itemize}
\item Get more accurate TF to checkerboard (Add to code)
\item Change manip daemon to use joint angles
\item Write test code for joint angles manip cmd
\item Get better calibration points
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 16}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed bug in zmp-daemon which caused discontinuity
\item Got rid of unused code in zmp-daemon
\item Merged risky/daemonize into grey/daemonize
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 13}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item While testing current control using KAIST's method, Grey discovered that we'd been using Dan Lofaro's filter b/c in the control daemon use\_filter was set to false and then immediately set back to true.
\item This cause lots of distortion using a .25s window, which screwed up the timing of the zmp walking.
\item We tested trajectory without the filter and after fixing a bug it works fine now and the timing is accurate!
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 03}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Started writing zmp atomic trajectories concept.
\item Basically, slice trajectories up into their individual steps so we can just piece them together. This way we can generate all atomic trajectories for each walk type all at once, and then use them on the fly, which gets rid of the generation time when changing directions.
\end{itemize}

\section*{June 01}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote preview controller for model that includes angular momentum. It's located in ZmpPreview.h in hubomz/src
\item Doesn't converge with current values
\end{itemize}

\section*{May 28}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Changed zmp-daemon to send one trajectory and have zmpgui/walker reuse the periodic portion of it.
\item This decreased the cpu usage of zmp-daemon from 100\% to about 2\%.
\end{itemize}

\section*{May 13}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Got OpenGL zmpgui to run trajectories continuously.
\end{itemize}

\section*{May 12}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added keyboard controls to zmp-daemon for walking forward/backward, sidestepping and turning.
\end{itemize}


\section*{May 11}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Walktype "canned" doesn't account for initial conditions. Need to get rid of it and use footstep.cpp walk functions
\item Where is best swap-in point? At end of double-support, have max CoM and joint velocities.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Thoughts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use last ZMPReferenceContext element in the ref vector in walker after adding 2nd to last step as the initContext for the next trajectory.
\end{itemize}

\section*{May 10}
\subsection*{Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Discovered ach doesn't work between computers with different architectures. Need to made struct variables uint\#, etc. and use \_\_attribute\_\_((packed))
\item Swapping in trajectories results in large joint velocities (ie. discontinuity). Something is wrong!
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Thoughts}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item Change structs that we're passing over ach to \_\_attribute\_\_((packed)) and specify variable sizes using inttypes.h (ie. uint8)
\end{itemize}
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item Does walker modify joint angles at all?
\item Validate swap point inside zmp-daemon
\item Plot it
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{May 09}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created walker flowchart and state machine
\newline \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{resources/walker-flowchart}
\end{itemize}

\section*{May  07}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Made preliminary state machine for zmp-daemon and walker for continuous trajectory generation
\item Created zmpdemo flowchart
\newline \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{resources/zmp-daemon-flowchart}
\item Edited walking-pipeline and added diagram of continuous walking receding horizon
\newline \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{resources/zmp-walking-pipeline}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Apr 29 - May 5}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generated evaluation times for the zmpdemo code for different types and
number of footsteps.
\item Gave final presentation with Xinyan on teleoperation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Apr 22-28}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sungmoon and I then planned out a schedule of small tasks to complete
achieve receding horizon online ZMP trajectory generation.
\item Evaluate generation time of trajectories for different types and number of
footsteps.
\item Achieve receding horizon using a button on the keyboard to walk in a straight
line.
\item Implement receding horizon online ZMP trajectory generation using
forward/backward and sidestep left/right using the keyboard.
\item Nishiwaki, Koichi, et al. "Online generation of humanoid walking motion based on
a fast generation method of motion pattern that follows desired zmp."
Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2002. IEEE/RSJ International Conference on. Vol.
3. IEEE, 2002.
\item The next task after completing this will be to start incorporating the footstep
planner and different walk types.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Future Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
\item Incorporation of footstep planner and different walk types.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Apr 15-21}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set the motion computer up to have a static ip address.
\item Read through the hubomz code and commented some of it. Primarily I commented the
ZmpPreview.h file, which is the actual zmp controller. The CoM inverse
kinematics was a little hard to understand, but I understand enough to move
forward with the finite horizon.
\item I read through the Nishiwaki (2002) paper which presents online generation of 
zmp walking trajectories. I modified Sungmoon's ZMP-Walking diagram and added
the online receding-horizon method.
\item Created presentation for TePRA with Rowland.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Apr 8-14}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Juan and I repaired Hubo's right hand pinky and middle fingers. The pinky
just need the set screw that hold the pulley on the motor shaft tightened. The
middle finger was the one previously broken and we just re-glued it with krazy
glue.
\item I wrote a simple hand program to open and close the fingers using the keyboard.
In doing so I discovered a bug and investigated the Hubo-ach code with Grey and
came up with some possible culprits. Grey later fixed it.
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/hand.cpp}
\item Set up everything for National Robotics Week and conducted the teleportation
with the kids.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Apr 1-7}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item I helped Xinyan daemonize Liberty and cleaned up everything.
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/Liberty-Daemon}
\item I updated the teleop-arms and teleop-legs code to accept arguments and make it
easier to understand
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/teleop-arms.cpp}
\item I made a separate Collision\_Checker class. Currently, there's only a checker for
the arms, but a legs one will be added in the future.
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/Collision\_Checker.cpp}
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/include/Collision\_Checker.h}
\item I worked with Juan to get started tested grasping with the fingers. We
discovered the control daemon had some bugs related to the fingers because they
were never needed and therefore never tested and debugged. We notified Grey and
he fixed the bugs.
\item I thoroughly explained the impedance controller to Xinyan, which helped me
understand some details I was unaware of.
\item I updated the Fastrak class to accept the Fastrak or the Liberty tracker and
renamed it to Teleop.cpp
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/Teleop.cpp}
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/include/Teleop.h}
\item I fixed the compiler issues with Max's testIK.cpp code which he wrote to do a
unit test on the FK/IK for Hubo.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Feb 18-24}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Xinyan and I got the Polhemus Liberty tracker fully working and tested. We
removed Fastrak completely and are now only using Liberty.
\item I added a simple self-collision avoidance function based on an ellipse-shaped
boundary. I added it to Hubo\_Control.cpp and ellipse parameters to
Hubo\_Control.h in my forked repo on the collision-avoidance branch.
\item I helped Andrew a bit to debug issues with hubo\_state and with moving the hand
to the location of the red object. He got that working! Videos are on his page.
\item Helped get Max started on writing a UnitTest for the FK and IK.
\item The working zmpdemo walking parameters for the video were:
\begin{itemize}
\item ./zmpdemo ../myhubo.kinbody.xml -w canned -z 0.06 -y 0.0885 -d 0.01 -s 0.5 -A -c
\item 8 -p 2 -X 0.038 -h 0.5 -l 0.08
\item -w: walk type "canned", meaning straight line
\item -z: foot vertical lift-off height of 0.06m
\item -y: half distance between feet of 0.0885m
\item -d: double-support time of 0.01s
\item -s: single-support time of 0.5s
\item -c: max number of step = 8
\item -p: initial time spent with zmp stationary = 2s
\item -l: max length of footstep = 0.08m
\item -X: forward distance from ankle to zmp = 0.04m
\item -A: use ach
\end{itemize}
\item Sungmoon and I tried tuning the walking parameters as well as tried adding
gradually reduced step size steps at the end of the walk. This helped a little
bit. Raising the COM z-position from 0.48m to 0.50m and changing the zmp
distance in front of the ankle from 0.04m to 0.038m helped.
\item Sungmoon and I wrote an impedance controller for the arm, using the torque
sensors in the wrist.
\item Code:
\url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/impCtrl-arms.cpp}
\item Code: \url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/include/impedanceController.h} 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Mar 11-17}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rowland and I went through Matt Zucker's walking code and learned how he
was spoofing input for the z-coordinate (height) of the feet in order to
construct a zmp trajectory in the y-direction, which was being fed into his ZMP
Preview controller, which spat out COM trajectory. This was then used with the
inverse kinematics to obtain full-body joint trajectories.
\item Rowland and I started adding code to get forward movement of the feet and body.
\item Rowland and I finished adding forward walking to the code and kinematic
visualization with Matt's help.
\item I helped Saul understand and re-factor the zmpdemo.cpp code.
\item I watched and learned from Matt about how we were going to break the code into
multiple objects.
\item I added the details for the runZMPPreview(), runCOMIK() and dumTraj() functions
in our zmpWalkingGenerator.
\item I helped out with the actual implementation of the code on Hubo and figuring out
how to control Hubo's balancing such that walking would be possible.
\item Code: \url{https://github.com/golems/hubomz}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Mar 4-10}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Over the weekend Hubo's Right Hip Roll joint "broke" somehow. I took out
the control board and discovered that ground trace from the power socket to one
of the MOSFETs was burned out due to over-current. We swapped power, encoder and
limit switch cables with the Right Hip Yaw and turned on motor control with
Hubo-i and it worked fine. Therefore, there should be no issues mechanically,
and just a replacement of the board should fix the problem. The cause of the
failure is still not clear. We are aware that Hubo was designed with pretty much
no safety factors, so if somehow he was being commanded to stand, etc. for too
long without cooling down then an over-current may have occurred naturally. This
just means we need to be more conscious of Hubo's limits and how we test him.
\item Pushkar helped me install Dart/Grip again from source with a different install
method for fcl. This got most of the tabs and worlds working, but not all of
them. Still can't install from the apt repo for some reason.
\item Worked on porting our Inverse Kinematics code over to Ivan's WalkingTab.
\item I helped XinYan test his Polhemus Liberty daemon by using it to send Liberty
sensor data from XinYan's computer to Hubo using achd and controlling Hubo's
right arm via the sensor. It worked, but seemed a bit different than when using
Fastrak. Need to do more testing, and test with the left leg to figure out why
it's different.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Feb 25 - Mar 3}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ana and I added a function to the Hubo\_Tech library that calculates the
center of mass w.r.t. the neck, which is the world frame for the FK and IK.
Ana and I starting writing a balance daemon that uses the center of mass model
and the force/torque sensors in the ankles.
\item The Ethernet cable connected to PC2 was tripped over and the plastic socket was
snapped off the circuit board on Hubo. I got a new socket from James Steinberg
in Van Leer, desoldered the old ethernet socket on the Smart Power board and
soldered on a new one.
\item I spent a day working with Ivan to figure out how to control joints easily in
Dart.
\item I finally installed Dart/Grip after doing a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04 but
the worlds still wouldn't load.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
\item For walking a clear state machine idea has been formed, but we just need
to implement it.
\item For Dart/Grip I will talk to Pushkar, etc. on Monday to resolve the issues.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Feb 18-24}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Andrew and I tested running a program on PC1 and sending the commands over
Ach to PC2 and while the daemons were running on PC2, but we are having issues.
We are doing something wrong with the communication.
\item I got the Polhemus Liberty working with PiTerm. I then wrote a simpler version
that got rid of all the GTK GUI stuff. I still need to parse the string of data
into an array and daemonize it.
\item XinYan and I tested the leg FK/IK and discovered that the problem was Grey's
ordering of the leg joints in control-daemon.h was different than that of
Rowland and me. The Hip Yaw and Hip Pitch were switched, so Grey changed them to
match our FK/IK.
\item I also discovered that because we had that miscommunication about the joint
ordering, the limits for the Hip Yaw and Pitch in our IK solution were swapped!
\item XinYan and I got Fastrak working with the legs. However, we discovered that the
leg IK doesn't handle the situation when the goal position is outside the
workspace properly, and returns -nan as the goal joint angle for the Hip Pitch,
Knee and Ankle Pitch. We are working on fixing this.
\item Andrew and I were able to read the state channel from the Vision PC, but not
write to the Ref channel.
\item I fixed the Leg IK code. It was returning -nan for joints 3, 4 and 5 (RHP, RKN
and RAP) when the goal was outside the workspace. I changed the square roots in
the calculations of the joint angles to be csqrt (complex sqrt) and changed the
radical to type 'double complex'. The norm between the goal position and the
solution positions wasn't being calculated with the correct goal position
because it was changed at the top of the function. The ordering of the limits
for the leg joints was wrong as well, because the hip pitch and hip yaw values
were switched.
\item I wrote a program to control the position and orientation of the feet using two
Fastrak sensors! It works really well, and has no issues when you move the
sensors outside the workspace of the feet.
\item Ana and I integrated her dart\_Lite library into the hubo-motion-rt library and
verified that it loads the URDF file in successfully.
\item I helped get XinYan set up with Liberty and he got it working on his own laptop
with Ubuntu via USB. He will continue to finish the writing of the read function
and daemon.
\item I took the neck off Hubo and tightened the loose screws so that if a camera is
temporarily mounted on the neck, any unnecessary looseness wouldn't be a
problem.
\item Hubo 4-Limb Teleoperation: Hubo's four limbs are being controlled using 4
different motion tracking sensors from the Polhemus Fastrak device. I have a
sensor taped to each foot and one in each hand. We are using the relative
translation of the sensors and the absolute orientations relative to the Fastrak
base station. These transformations are mapped to Hubo's hands and feet using
the inverse and forward kinematics of the arms and legs. Using an instantaneous
transformation to, for example, the Fastrak sensor in my left hand, we input
that transformation, or pose, into the inverse kinematics for Hubo's left arm to
determine the best joint angles solutions to produce that position and
orientation of the hand. The inverse kinematics generates eight possible
solutions, of which only a few could be possible, given joint limits and and
workspace considerations. If no solution contains six joint angles that are
within the joint limits, then the solution that gives a position closest to the
goal position is found by taking the norm of the vector between the goal
position and the position given a solution of joints that are scaled to comply
with the limits.
\item Code for teleop of the arms: \url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/fastrak-arms.cpp}
\item Code for teleop of the legs: \url{https://github.com/pvieira3/hubo-misc/blob/master/test-code/src/fastrak-legs.cpp}
\end{itemize}

\item Rowland, Grey and I successfully cut out a 15x10cm square in
cardboard using Fastrak motion tracking for the right hand and for squatting.
\item Rowland and I finished writing the TePRA paper and submitted it.
\item Rowland and I also fixed the IK and FK code so that the teleoperation in
workspace works for 3-DOF.
\item Ana and I tested a simple version of center of mass calculation for the right
leg. When we moved the leg, the location of the center of mass moved in the
correct directions, but not with correct magnitudes. 
\item Hubo Cutting Rectangle in Cardboard: 01/25/2013. This is a video of Hubo cutting
a 15x10cm rectangle in cardboard, with two different camera angles, a main
closeup view of the cut, and a second, smaller view in the top-right corner of
the board, Hubo and the teleoperator in the background. We balanced him using
his ankle motors, which are velocity controlled using just a proportional term.
They are compliant with the moments about his ankles, but resistant against the
angle of his torso with respect to the vertical in order to keep him upright. He
has a Dremel strapped to his hand with a drill bit insert. We use the inverse
kinematics of the arm and a Polhemus Fastrak Motion Tracking device to move his
arm horizontally. By lowering the tracking device, Hubo also lowers by bending
at the knees. These two degrees of freedom allow Hubo to cut out the rectangle.

\subsection*{Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The modeling of the center of mass is going a little slow, because the
URDF file is hard to interpret and doesn't seem accurate.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Jan 14-20}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item I was able to get Hubo to squat on Monday with just a bit of sway. The
sway is due to the fact that the ankles are not matching the speed of the hips,
which causes the torso to lean forward or backwards, so when Hubo stops moving
he has to rotate his ankles to return his torso to the vertical orientation.
This can be solved possibly by adjust the gains on the ankle pitch velocity.
\item Grey and I performed cardboard cutting with the Fastrak and the dremel. We
used the Drill IK that Rowland wrote and just varied the y-position in order to
create a smooth cut along a straight line. We were able to get Hubo to cut an
8-inch line in the cardboard, but then the wrist broke loose due to experience a
torque greater than its maximum allowable.
\item We also performed teleoperation of the dremel arm while using another sensor to control squating. We achieved this by using the dimensions of Hubo and some simple trigonometry.
\item I helped Andrew to get a webcam tracking a red piece of paper. Then, as the paper moved across the webcam's view, Hubo would move his arm in the same directions along the y-z plane. Andrew got this working using OpenCV and Boost for the vision and object tracking, and sockets in order to send the relative motions to Hubo's Linux computer. We need to adjust some of the transformations since Hubo's arm was not responding exactly as we expected.
\item I wrote a program to control both of Hubo's arms with the Fastrak sensors, as well as his waist with a third sensor. It is slightly different than the original one that Grey wrote, which didn't perform as hoped, possible due to the IK solutions and possibly due to there only being six DOF controlling six DOF, coupled with Hubo's limited worskpace. I will test my version on Monday, January 21st.
\item Hubo Squatting: 01/18/2013. This is a video of Hubo balancing and squatting. His ankles are velocity controlled using just a proportional term. They are compliant with the moments about his ankles, but resistant against the angle of his torso with respect to the vertical in order to stay upright. He squats by adjusting the velocity of his knee joints and then setting the hip and ankle joints to half the knee velocity.
\item Hubo Balancing \& Teleop (LEFT): 01/18/2013. This is a video of Hubo being controlled via teleoperation to balancing, squat and move his right arm. He balances using his ankles, which are velocity controlled using just a proportional term. They are compliant with the moments about his ankles, but resistant against the angle of his torso with respect to the vertical in order to stay upright. We use the inverse kinematics of the arm and move it horizontally using a Polhemus Fastrak Motion Tracking device. He squats by adjusting the velocity of his knee joints and then setting the hip and ankle joints to half the knee velocity.
\item Hubo Wall Cut (RIGHT): 01/18/2013. This is a video of Hubo cutting a line in cardboard. He balances using his ankles, which are velocity controlled using just a proportional term. They are compliant with the moments about his ankles, but resistant against the angle of his torso with respect to the vertical in order to stay upright. He has a dremel with a drill bit strapped to his hand. We use the inverse kinematics of the arm and move it horizontally using a Polhemus Fastrak Motion Tracking device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The balancing and squating work fine, but for anything more, we need the calculation of the center of mass. This way we won't have to rely on the IMU and we can just give a point of the floor for where to put Hubo's center of mass. This should make it possible to walk in a logical manner.
\item The webcam object tracking control of Hubo's arm exhibited some good response, but I definitely mixed up the IK for the drill and the hand and thus the transformations are wrong. This is an easy fix though.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
\item Get data for the wall cutting. We will get Fastrak data and Forward Kinematics data, and plot the two against each other.
\item Pick an object up with two hands using Fastrak.
\item Get the calculation of the center of mass and verify that it's correct
\end{itemize}

\section*{Jan 07-13}
\subsection*{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finished writing the rough draft of the TePRA 2013 paper \href{https://thebrain.golems.org/svn/papers/2013/TePRA-13-hubo\_teleopTasks/}
{"Humanoid Robot Teleoperation for Dual-Arm Tasks with Power Tools"} with Rowland
O'Flaherty. This paper presents the implementation of inverse kinematics to
achieve teleoperation of a physical Hubo+ robot platform. Using a closed-form
kinematic solution and a basic feedback controller, teleoperation of simple
tasks is realized. The Hubo+ platform will be used to compete in the DARPA Robot
Challenge, which requires autonomous execution of various tasks; such as,
cutting through walls and moving rumble. Joint limits and singularities are
accounted for using the different cases in the kinematic solution; and a
decision method is implemented to determine how to position the end-effector
when the goal is outside the feasible workspace.
\item Achieved balancing with Grey. We did this by using velocity control
for the pitch and roll joints of the left and right ankles. We designed the
controller so that the ankles are compliant with the moments about the ankle
joints, but resistant against the waist IMU angle. These are both proportional
terms. We originally tried using position control with P, PD and PID type
controllers but found that oscillation would occur. The following is the code we
used.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
\item We had some trouble getting Hubo to bend at the knees and hips in
order to lower, but Grey had an idea to set the ankle velocity equal to the hip
velocity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
\item Get Hubo to act like a spring, where if you press down on his
shoulders he'll lower, keeping his back vertical, and if you let off he'll rise
back up.
\item Cut through cardboard with the dremel by using the IK for the arm and
bending his legs in order to increase range of drilling motion.
\item Update the TePRA paper with results from dremel experimentation and
hopefully moving "rubble."
